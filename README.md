## Compromises Made

1. **In-Memory Storage:**
   - The current implementation stores the token buckets in memory. This means that if the service is restarted, all rate limiting data is lost. This approach was chosen for simplicity and ease of development, but it is not suitable for production environments where persistence is necessary.

2. **Single Instance Operation:**
   - The service is designed to run as a single instance. This limits scalability and fault tolerance, as there is no mechanism to share state between multiple instances of the service.

3. **Static Configuration:**
   - The rate limits are loaded from a static configuration file (`config.json`) at startup. Any changes to rate limits require a restart of the service to take effect.

## Gaps

1. **Lack of Persistence:**
   - The service does not persist the state of the token buckets to any external storage. As a result, any restart or crash will reset all rate limits.

2. **No Authentication or Security:**
   - Since the service is designed to run within an internal network, no authentication or security measures are implemented. This could be a potential risk if the service is exposed to external networks.

3. **Limited Metrics and Monitoring:**
   - The service does not provide any built-in metrics or monitoring capabilities. This makes it difficult to track usage patterns, identify abuse, or debug issues.

4. **Fixed Token Refill Rate:**
   - The token refill rate is fixed based on the sustained rate and does not account for bursty traffic patterns that might require more dynamic rate adjustments.

## Future Improvements

1. **Persistent Storage:**
   - Implement persistent storage (e.g., Redis, database) to store the state of the token buckets. This will ensure that rate limits are not reset on service restarts.

2. **Distributed Rate Limiting:**
   - Support distributed rate limiting by sharing state across multiple instances of the service. This can be achieved using a centralized data store or a distributed coordination service.

3. **Dynamic Configuration:**
   - Allow dynamic updating of rate limits without restarting the service. This could be achieved through an admin API or by watching the configuration file for changes.

4. **Advanced Analytics and Monitoring:**
   - Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to provide detailed analytics and metrics on rate limiting. This will help in identifying usage patterns and potential abuse.

5. **Authentication and Security:**
   - Implement authentication mechanisms to secure the service endpoints. This could include API keys, OAuth, or other authentication methods.

6. **Graceful Degradation:**
   - Implement mechanisms to gracefully degrade service when the rate limits are reached, such as queuing requests or providing informative error messages to clients.

7. **Enhanced Refill Logic:**
   - Improve the token refill logic to handle bursty traffic patterns more effectively. This could involve more sophisticated algorithms that adjust the refill rate based on observed traffic.

8. **Support for More HTTP Methods:**
   - Extend the rate limiting to support more HTTP methods (e.g., PUT, DELETE) and potentially apply different rate limits based on the method.

9. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Increase the test coverage to include edge cases, such as very high traffic scenarios, and ensure the service behaves as expected under various conditions.
